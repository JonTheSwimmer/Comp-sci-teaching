Here is your first practice. 
Make a program that writes out every number from 1 to an input number as a list. 
And yes, there is a way to do this in 1 line.
However, this is fairly advanced, so I don't expect anyone to actually write it out in one line.
Please label your files as namePractice1.py
Have fun =P
