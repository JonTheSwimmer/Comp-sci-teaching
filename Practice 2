YAAAAAAY
For this assignment, you will......
-dramatic break for tension-
make a graph!
*************************************
For this assignment, I want you to make a graph of a parabola.
In order to make graphs, you will need the visual and visual.graph modules
We can get these by using:
from visual import *
from visual.graph import *
(The star means "all" for import)
You will also need gcurve, which is the curve making function
As a refresher, you will define a function, like:
fnc1 = gcurve(color = color.(whatever color you want, like red, or orange, or cyan, or green. Python doesn't have every color though))
Then, when you're plotting things in your loop, you do:
fnc1.plot(pos = (x,y))

P.S.
If you want an extra challenge, graph a spiral

P.P.S.
If you really want to challenge yourself, graph a spiral that changes colour as you graph it.
I don't think this is possible with gcurve for reasons, so you'll need to use gdots to do this.
Have fun!
