YAAAAAAY
For this assignment, you will......
-dramatic break for tension-
make a graph!
*************************************
For this assignment, I want you to make a graph of a parabola from x = -20 to x = 20
In order to make graphs, you will need the visual and visual.graph modules
We can get these by using:
from visual import *
from visual.graph import *
(The star means "all" for import)
You will also need gcurve, which is the curve making function
As a refresher, you will define a function, like:
fnc1 = gcurve(color = color.(whatever color you want, like red, or orange, or cyan, or green. Python doesn't have every color though))
Then, when you're plotting things in your loop, you do:
fnc1.plot(pos = (x,y))

P.S.
If you want an extra challenge, graph a spiral

P.P.S.
If you really want to challenge yourself, graph a spiral that changes colour as you graph it.
I don't think this is possible with gcurve for reasons, so you'll need to use gdots to do this.
Custom colours can be make by specifying RGB values for the colour
Instead of saying (color = color.red), you would say (color = (value for red, value for green, value for blue))
These values can be any number from 0 to 1, with 1 being the maximum colour, and 0 being the minimum colour
Have fun!
