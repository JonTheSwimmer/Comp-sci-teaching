This will be a practice for Euler's method, which is coming up in the Bio assignment.
For this assignment, you will make a simulation of a planet's orbit around a star.
Yes, this will be difficult.
You are allowed to assume that the star does not move (although this is untrue).
Use Gmm/(r**2) to calculate the force.
Because we are doing an orbit, you will need to input masses, x and y positions, as well as initial x and y velocities
It is highly recommended that you give the planet NON-ZERO positions and velocities
A position of (0,0) will make your calcuations explode
A velocity of (0,0) will make the planet just fall towards the star, which isn't as bad as exploding calculations, but it is boring.
As a start, I will recommend making a while loop for these calculations, which should look like:
while (calculation for distance between star and planet) > 0 and (calculation for distance between star and planet) < Some large number:
The distance should be greater than 0 (or else the calculation blows up, as you divide by 0)
It also should stop after some very large distance, as if the planet moves far away enough from the star, it is unlikely to return.
Remember that Euler's can be written as:
x(t+dt) = x(t) + vx(t)*dt
vx(t+dt) = vx(t) + ax(t)*dt
By the way, it will make your life MUCH easier to put the star in the center of the graph (ie (0,0))

Extra hints:
You will need to define your timestep, G, x,y, vx, vy, mass of planet, and mass of star
Distance can be found using x and y co-ordinates with a very simple formula that all of you should know. The only hint I'm giving you is right-hand triangles.

If you want an extra challenge, you can let the star move as well
If you really want to challenge yourself, you could add charges to the planet and star as well, although quite frankly, that's just tedious.
